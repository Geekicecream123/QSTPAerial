# Week I: Basic Python Programming ([Credits](https://github.com/adbidwai/QSTP-Robotics_Automation_using_ROS/tree/master/week1))
Python is an essential tool in Robotics. Its ease of use and flexibility makes it perfect for rapid prototyping. Nearly all of the code in this course will be written in Python.

In the first week you should aim to understand the following fundamental concepts. They are what you will be using 90% of the time while programming -

- Data Types
- Operators
- Control Flow (Branching and Looping)
- Functions
- Classes

Here are a learning resources to get you started. Apart from these the internet has an abundance of python tutorials.

- Bytes of Python is included in this repo (and can also be found [here](https://python.swaroopch.com/)) . Till Chapter 1.10 _Functions_ is recommended.
- Intro to Computer Science course on edX which can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). The first three weeks are recommended.
- Sentdex's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln) on python.
- A few example ipython notebooks: [1](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/lesson1_part_1.ipynb), [2](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/lesson1_part_2.ipynb), [3](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Deep-Learning-TIP/blob/master/Week_1/Lesson_2_numpy.ipynb) (credits [SAiDL](https://github.com/SforAiDl/))
