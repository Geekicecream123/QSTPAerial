# QSTP - Aerial Robotics: Path Planning and State Estimation

All material regarding the __Aerial Robotics: Path Planning and State Estimation__ 2021 can be found in this repository. The outline of this repository:

1. Week wise split content.
2. Each week will be accompanied by its own `README`, `RESOURCES`, `ASSIGNMENT` mardown files.
3. Every week, there will be some resource put on the `RESOURCES` file. This can be updated during the progress of the week to help solve some doubts.
4. After the completion of a week, an Assignment will be given. The Questions and Submission of the Assignment will be mentioned in the `ASSIGNMENT` file itself.
5. Wherever possible the Assignments will be given using Colab notebooks so that the hassle of installing various packages etc. be eliminated.

## Introduction to Aerial Robotics
This course is a primer to anybody interested in Aerial Robotics. The course introduces
Path planning in 3D and State Estimation for Aerial Robots, with the aim of setting
students in the right direction for further education in the field of Aerial Robotics.

The course starts off with the basics of Python programming, followed by introduction to
path planning in two dimensions as a precursor to the same in 3D. Path Planning in 3D
will be dealt with in greater detail. The course then moves on to State Estimation and
Odometry for Aerial vehicles in 3 Dimensions.

Every week, Python notebooks shall be put up in the Course Repository. The notebooks
are intended to ease the studentsâ€™ work of writing algorithms from scratch. Every
notebook shall be considered for final Evaluation. Research paper discussion sessions
shall be conducted, where state-of-the-art algorithms shall be discussed.

## Week wise Overview
- Week I: Basics of Python Programming.
- Week II: Seach based Path Planning.
- Week III: Sampling based Path Planning.
- Week IV: Introduction to Kalman and Bayesian Filters.
- Week V: State Estimation Machinery.
- Week VI: Final Project.
